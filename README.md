  His videos are always useful when you don't fully understand some concepts or you want to go the extra mile in a specific area of CSS. Subscription to his channel is a MUST!
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
  I know some people prefer MDN documentation (which is also really good) but I prefer W3Schools. I find it to be so much easier to navigate through website.
